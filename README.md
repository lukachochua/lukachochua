# Luka Chochua (@lukachochua)

Laravel-focused developer building practical SaaS products for regulated SMB workflows in Georgia (pawnshops, warehouses, invoicing/waybills, RBAC, audit trails). Also a sports journalist / on-air contributor (Georgia Public Broadcaster) — I care about clarity, systems, and shipping.

---

## What I build

- **Laravel 12.x apps** (modern conventions, clean Blade structure, request validation, services where it matters)
- **Filament 3 admin systems** (Resources/Pages/Widgets, RBAC, CRUD-heavy business domains)
- **Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js UI** (brandbook-driven components, predictable UX, not framework soup)
- **Workflow automation & integrations** (e.g., RS.ge waybill SOAP-style XML flows, logging, retries)
- **Deployment & ops** (Linux-first: Pop!_OS dev, Hetzner servers, SSH, queues, logs, env hygiene)

## Current focus

### DGstep
A professional Laravel + Tailwind + Alpine website and product direction for regulated service businesses.  
Emphasis: sharp UI, component discipline, bilingual UX, and a clear path to a real SaaS backend.

### Warehouse / logistics admin (Filament)
A Filament-based warehouse management platform with expanded workflows and domain services.  
Includes integration work (e.g., waybill, invoice flows), role/permission patterns, audit-style logging, and queue processing.

### Pawn App foundation
Early-stage Laravel project groundwork: migrations, seeders, Spatie Permission setup, and Azure-ready user structure.

## Skills (honest version)

### Strong / reliable
- Laravel fundamentals (routing, controllers, validation, DB work, auth patterns)
- Filament CRUD architecture and admin UX
- UI implementation with Tailwind/Blade/Alpine (componentized, consistent)
- Shipping features end-to-end (from DB → UI → deploy)
- Debugging in Linux environments (logs, processes, server issues)

### Good, improving fast
- Domain architecture (services, events, observers, boundaries)
- Integrations that are “annoying by nature” (SOAP/XML, strict specs, edge cases)
- Testing discipline (feature tests, integration tests) - I can do it, but I’m still building the habit

### Not claiming (yet)
- Deep low-level performance tuning / internals
- Large-scale distributed systems
- “Perfect” DevOps automation (I deploy and maintain systems, but I’m still maturing CI/CD rigor)

## What I can realistically build solo

✅ **Very realistic**
- Production-grade CRUD SaaS for SMBs (RBAC, auditing, exports, admin UX)
- Filament admin panels with complex business flows
- Branded marketing + auth + dashboard systems
- Integrations with strict external specs (with enough time to test/iterate)

⚠️ **Realistic, but best with a team/time**
- Multi-tenant SaaS with complex billing + permissions at scale
- Heavy realtime systems (chat-like), event streaming, advanced observability
- Large public consumer apps with unpredictable traffic spikes

---

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel 12.x  
- **Admin:** Filament 3, Spatie Permission  
- **Frontend:** Blade, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Vite  
- **DB/Infra:** MySQL/MariaDB, queues/workers, Linux, Hetzner

---

## How I work

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Keep UI systems **consistent and brand-driven**
- Avoid over-engineering, but I **don’t ship spaghetti**
- I like tasks that involve: specs → edge cases → logs → clean fix

---

## Open to

- Laravel/Filament SaaS work (especially admin-heavy systems)
- Workflow automation/integrations (finance, logistics, regulated services)
- Collaborations where shipping matters more than hype
